# TimeUnits

Just a simple alternative to the activesupport helpers if you don't want to
add activesupport as dependency to your gem/application.

It works the same way:

```ruby
2.hours
1.minute
3.weeks
```



# Duration

Another activesupport alternative

```ruby
120.human_duration => "2 mins"
```
